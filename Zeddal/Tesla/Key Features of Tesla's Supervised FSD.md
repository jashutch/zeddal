# Key Features of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) - Supervised

## Overview
Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology offers a range of advanced driver-assistance features. It's important to note that despite its name, FSD requires the driver to be engaged at all times, as it is not fully autonomous. Here are the essential capabilities and considerations of Tesla's FSD in its current supervised mode.

## Capabilities
### Traffic Control Response
- **Automatic stopping** at traffic lights and stop signs.
- **Responsive actions** based on traffic control signals.

### Highway Navigation
- **Entering and exiting** highway ramps.
- **Automatic lane changes** and adjustments at highway forks.

### City and Residential Driving
- **Navigating city streets** and residential areas.
- **Making turns** and recognizing various road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.

### Environmental Visualization
- **Real-time visualization** on the vehicle's screen showing detected objects like vehicles, curbs, and cyclists.

### Driver Monitoring System
- **In-cabin cameras** monitor the driver’s attentiveness.
- **Alerts** are issued if the driver is found to be inattentive, with the system potentially disengaging.

## Subscription and Hardware Requirements
### Subscription Model
- Available on a **subscription basis** in some markets, allowing users to pay monthly (e.g., $99 in the U.S. for eligible vehicles) instead of an upfront purchase.

### Hardware Eligibility and Cost
- Requires a **specific FSD computer** and an array of cameras and sensors.
- The **cost of upgrades** has varied, historically around $12,000.

## Regulatory and Geographical Limitations
- Not all features are available in every country or region due to **regulatory and mapping constraints**.

## Safety and Responsibility
### Level of Autonomy
- Tesla's FSD is categorized as **SAE Level 2**, where the human driver must remain responsible and ready to intervene.
- It is not **Level 4 or 5** (fully driverless).

### Performance Conditions
- Performance can degrade or the system may not engage in poor conditions such as **obstructed cameras, bad weather, or unknown roads**.

### Driver's Responsibilities
- Drivers must **keep their hands on the wheel** and be prepared to take control at any moment.
- The system should not be mistaken for a **hands-off autopilot** technology.

## Criticisms of the "Full Self-Driving" Name
- Tesla uses the term "Full Self-Driving" to align with its long-term goals of achieving full autonomy. However, the current technology does not support unsupervised driving.
- The name has led to **criticisms and concerns** about potentially misleading consumers regarding the current capabilities of the technology.

By staying informed about the capabilities and limitations of Tesla's FSD, users can better understand their responsibilities and the operational scope of the system.
