# Comprehensive Inspection Guide for Tesla Vehicles

This guide is designed to help potential buyers or current owners of Tesla vehicles understand critical areas to inspect to ensure the vehicle's optimal performance and longevity. Here, we break down the primary areas of concern into clear sections.

### 1. Battery Health and Charging Behavior
- **Degradation**: Check the battery's health by observing the range displayed on the screen. Compare this with the original Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) range estimates, which are between 390 to 396 miles for the 2021 and 2024 models. A battery in good condition should retain about 90% to 95% of its capacity even after 30,000 to 40,000 miles.## 1. Drive Unit and Suspension Components
- **Front Suspension**: Check control arms and links especially in early Plaid models which may develop creaks or looseness. Tesla has issued several revisions for these parts.
- **Half Shafts**: Watch for shutter under acceleration, as hard launches can wear CV joints. It's advisable to test these under full throttle.
- **Brakes**: Due to regenerative braking, physical brake wear may be concealed. Inspect rotor surfaces and calipers for corrosion or uneven pad seating.

## 2. Interior Fit, Finish, and Screen Issues
- **Yoke Steering**: The finish and capacitive buttons on the yoke steering wheel may degrade prematurely. Check the responsiveness of turn signals.
- **Center Display**: Look for ghosting or delamination. Some screens may exhibit heat-related haze or touch screen lag; verify screen responsiveness.
- **Seat Wear**: Inspect seats for creasing, particularly in Alcantara or vegan leather, which may occur from high bolstering.

## 3. Electronics, Software, and Autopilot Systems
- **Firmware**: Ensure the vehicle is running the current firmware version as older builds may lack key features.
- **Autopilot and Full Self-Driving**: If purchasing a used vehicle, confirm whether features like FSD or Enhanced Autopilot are transferable.
- **MCU and Connectivity**: Check LTE reception and Bluetooth stability. For early 2021 models, verify if an MCU2 retrofit has been installed.

## 4. Thermal Management and Cooling
- **Heat Pump System**: Be alert for coolant valve leaks within the heat pump system. Listen for loud fans or erratic AC performance.
- **Track Use**: If the car was used on a racetrack, inspect coolant lines, pump housing, and the condition of the drive unit oil.

## 5. Body and Exterior
- **Panel Alignment**: Although Tesla's build quality has improved, inspect the gaps around the front, trunk, and tail lights for uniformity.
- **Paint Quality**: Dark colors, particularly black, may show micro swirls or a thin clear coat. Consider using a paint meter to verify thickness.
- **Door Handles and Power Trunk**: Test all door handles and soft close functions, as actuators may fail.

## 6. Performance and Testing
- **Launch Mode Functionality**: Engage Cheetah Stance mode to ensure the suspension height actuates correctly.
- **Battery and Tire Wear**: Due to the Plaid's torque, check for inside tire wear and ensure tread depth is even across all corners.

## 7. Warranty, Service History, and Recalls
- **Warranty Transfer**: Confirm the status and transferability of the eight-year battery and drive unit warranty.
- **Service Records**: Request the full Tesla service history, which can be accessed via the owner’s Tesla app or Tesla service portal.
- **Recalls**: Use the VIN to check for outstanding software or hardware recalls at NHTSA.gov.

## Summary
The **Tesla Model S Plaid** is a highly advanced electric vehicle (EV) known for its tri-motor all-wheel drive, impressive horsepower exceeding 1,000, and advanced software integration. Despite its cutting-edge features, potential buyers, especially of used or early production models, should perform a thorough evaluation to ensure they are making a reliable purchase.
