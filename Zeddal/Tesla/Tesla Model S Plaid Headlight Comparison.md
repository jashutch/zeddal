# [Tesla [Model S Plaid](https://www.tesla.com/models)](https://www.tesla.com/models) Headlight Comparison

This note explores the differences between the standard LED headlight setup found in the 2021 [[[Tesla Model S]]](https://www.tesla.com/models) Plaid and the newer adaptive matrix LED headlight system introduced by Tesla, Inc. in subsequent models. We will cover how to identify these differences, the enhancements provided by the new technology, and important considerations associated with each system.

## 2021 Tesla Model S Plaid Headlights

- **Standard Features**: The 2021 Model S Plaid comes equipped with LED headlamps that include automatic high and low beam capabilities along with adaptive headlights.
- **Functionality**: The term "adaptive headlights" in this context likely refers to the system's ability to automatically switch between high and low beams. It may also include basic adaptations such as beam angle adjustments or leveling, but it does not encompass the more advanced matrix LED system capabilities.
- **Capabilities**: While the 2021 headlights were advanced for their time, offering functionalities like curve-tilting, they did not feature the full pixel matrix dynamic lighting technology.

## Adaptive Matrix LED Headlights (2022 and Beyond)

- **Introduction of Matrix Headlights**: Starting in 2022, Tesla began rolling out advanced matrix headlights, or adaptive high-beam systems with pixel-level control, in the U.S. This system has been included in newer models and is being activated in phases through software updates.
- **Functionality and Features**:
  - **Automatic Beam Adjustment**: The beam automatically adjusts to curves and changes in headlight and traffic conditions. 
  - **Pixel Dimming**: When high beams are not necessary, the system can dim individual pixels within the headlight cluster to prevent glare from affecting oncoming drivers. This allows the headlights to remain highly effective by illuminating the road ahead while minimizing disruption to other road users.
  - **Steering Responsive**: The new headlight design can also respond to steering inputs, altering the beam direction in sync with the steering movements to enhance visibility around curves.
- **Safety and Visibility Enhancements**: The matrix setup significantly improves visibility, particularly around side curves, and reduces glare for other drivers, enhancing overall safety.

## Conclusion

The transition from the standard LED headlights to the adaptive matrix LED system in Tesla vehicles represents a significant technological advancement, offering enhanced functionality and safety features. By understanding these differences, owners and potential buyers can better appreciate the innovations Tesla continues to integrate into their vehicles.
