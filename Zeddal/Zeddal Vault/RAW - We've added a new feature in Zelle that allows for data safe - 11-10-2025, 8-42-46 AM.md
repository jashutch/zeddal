# We've added a new feature in Zelle that allows for data safe

We've added a new feature in Zelle that allows for data safety and audio persistence, allowing us to save to whatever folder we want, timestamped file names, metadata with the JSON file stored alongside audio with the file path, the timestamp, the duration, MIME type and size, optional cache transcription results and full CRUD operations, save, load, update, delete, list recordings.
