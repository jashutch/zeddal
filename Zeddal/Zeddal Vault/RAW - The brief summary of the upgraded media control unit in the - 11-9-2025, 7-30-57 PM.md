The brief summary of the upgraded media control unit in the [[Tesla Model S]] Plaid from 2022 until the model's recent refresh. The 17-inch landscape-oriented main touchscreen features a resolution of about 2200 by 1300 pixels and is driven by a new infotainment system based on an AMD or a Navi 23-style GPU. The system is described by Tesla and reviewers as delivering roughly 10 teraflops of computing power, enabled console-level gaming, high-resolution media streaming, and a more responsive UI. Connectivity and hardware highlights include multiple USB-C ports and wireless charging pads for front and rear passengers, Wi-Fi and LTE connectivity with support for higher bandwidth functions such as video streaming, game controller input, etc. The UI was substantially revamped. The display shifts functions into apps, media, navigation, games, and allows flexible layout, resizing of the media panel next to the map. In terms of passenger experience, there is also a dedicated rear seat touchscreen for media play controls.
