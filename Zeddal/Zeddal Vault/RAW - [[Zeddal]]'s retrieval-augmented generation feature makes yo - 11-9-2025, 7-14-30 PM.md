# [[Zeddal]]'s retrieval-augmented generation feature makes yo

[[Zeddal]]'s retrieval-augmented generation feature makes your AI-assisted transcription sound like you, matching your tone, structure, and vocabulary instead of generic AI phrasing. When you enable RAG, [[Zeddal]] automatically indexes your vault, all markdown files are divided into 500 token chunks, generates embeddings, each chunk receives a unique numerical footprint that captures its meaning and writing style, builds a searchable history, the system maintains an up-to-date index as you edit or add notes. When you record and refine a voice note, [[Zeddal]] finds the three most relevant passages from your vault based on topic and style, supplies those references to GPT-4 as context, produces a refined note that blends seamlessly with your existing writing. [[Zeddal]] RAG supports both OpenAI cloud embeddings and local or air-gap servers for secure environments. If RAG is disabled or temporarily unavailable, note refinement continues normally, just without vault-based personalization.
