New features implemented as of today, 10th of Monday, the 10th of November, 2025. Settings for recordings path. I have added a recordings path setting in configs and typed a default path as now voice notes and forward slash recordings within Obsidian. Users can now configure where audio files are saved in the [[Zeddal]] settings tab. Settings UI added under recording settings section. Drag and drop functionality has been implemented for global drag and drop handler in the main TS. Supports multiple audio formats, WebM, MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG. When audio files are dropped into Obsidian, file is automatically saved to the recordings folder. Record modal opens with the existing audio loaded and skips recording step and goes directly to transcription options. Toast notifications provide feedback during the process. And finally we have audio playback button for playing the recording and data persistence, audio persistence where you can save and the timestamps have been added.
