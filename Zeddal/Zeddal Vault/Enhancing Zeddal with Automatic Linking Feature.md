# Automatic Linking Feature in [[Zeddal]]

## Overview
The goal is to enhance **Zeddal**, our note-taking assistant, by integrating an automatic linking feature. This feature will intelligently detect and link existing notes within the same knowledge vault.

## Functionality
- **Keyword Matching:** When a user mentions a keyword such as "Zeddal note taking assistant," Zeddal should automatically identify this as a reference to an existing note within the vault.
- **Link Creation:** Upon identifying a match, Zeddal will generate a wiki-style link. This link can be clicked to direct the user to the referenced note, facilitating efficient navigation and interconnected learning.

## Expected Outcome
This feature will streamline the process of linking related concepts and notes, making the knowledge management process more intuitive and effective.
