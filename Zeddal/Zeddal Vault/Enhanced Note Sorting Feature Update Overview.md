# Feature Update: Enhanced Note Sorting Using Semantic Similarity

## Overview
In a recent update, a feature has been adjusted to improve the sorting and placement of notes within folders based on semantic similarity.

## Details of the Feature Update

### Previous Behavior
- Before the update, users were limited to saving notes only in the folder they were actively viewing or working in. This often required manual navigation and placement, which could be cumbersome and time-consuming.

### Enhanced Semantic Similarity
- The updated feature now leverages semantic similarity algorithms to analyze the content of a note.
- **Automatic Placement**: Once a note is created, the system automatically evaluates its content and matches it with the most contextually similar existing folder.
- This allows for a more intuitive and efficient organization of notes, as they are placed in folders that are semantically related to their content, without the need for manual intervention.

## Conclusion
This update significantly simplifies the user experience by automating the storage of notes into appropriate folders based on their semantic content. This enhances both the efficiency and the organization of notes within the system.
