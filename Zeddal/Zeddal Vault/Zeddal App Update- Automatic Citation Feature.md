# New Feature Overview for [[Zeddal]] App

## Automatic Citations

The latest update to the [[Zeddal]] app introduces an **automatic citation feature**. This enhancement leverages **[GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) technology** to add citations directly into the file as it is summarized. Users no longer need to manually insert URL links or hyperlinks for references used within the note, streamlining the note-taking and documentation process.
